### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Overall, I feel that the labs prepared me to complete the assignment. Each of the labs taught us about components that were incorporated in the final assignment. However, a few elements were a bit challenging. The grid view took some time to refine. Also, working with the API took some getting used to since we had to search and decide by ourselves which URLs would be most effective. Getting the specific information that we wanted from the API also required us to look through the JSON data. It was slightly intimitading to tackle the JavaScript portion, since I did not have a very deep understanding of the way JavaScript executes, such as the scope of variables and functions.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would try to deploy the project using Github Pages. I would also have maybe added a sorting or login feature.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
